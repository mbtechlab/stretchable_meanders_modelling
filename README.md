Modelling of stretchable meanders for static and dynamic loading in Abaqus
There are 4 files:
1.cu.cae 
2.cupi.cae 
3.cusr.cae 
4.cupisr.cae

File Structure
The repository includes the following four files:

1.cu.cae:
Model for stretchable meander made of copper.

2.cupi.cae:
Stretchable meander model combining copper (CU) and polyimide (PI) materials.

3.cusr.cae:
Stretchable meander model incorporating copper (CU) and silicon rubber (SR).

4.cupisr.cae:
Model combining copper (CU), polyimide (PI), and silicon rubber (SR) materials.

To run the models, follow these steps:

Install Abaqus: Ensure that Abaqus 2021 or a later version is installed.
Download the Repository: Download the files from this repository.
Open in Abaqus: Open the .cae files in Abaqus/CAE.
